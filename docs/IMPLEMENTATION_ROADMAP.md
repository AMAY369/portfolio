## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Waiting for Perfect Testimonials:** Launch with 3-5 and add more incrementally
2. **Over-Engineering:** Don't build custom CMS when MDX files work fine
3. **Vague Pricing:** "Contact for quote" reduces inquiries by 40%
4. **Too Technical:** Clients care about outcomes, not your tech choices
5. **Missing CTAs:** Every section should have a path to contact
6. **Ignoring Mobile:** 60%+ of traffic is mobile, test thoroughly
7. **No Social Proof:** Even 3 testimonials beat zero
8. **Analysis Paralysis:** Launch with MVP, iterate based on real data
