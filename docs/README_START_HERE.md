## 📋 **Critical Path Items**

These are **bottlenecks** that could delay your launch:

### **1. Testimonial Collection** (Days 1-3)
- Need minimum **5 testimonials** to launch
- Start outreach TODAY
- Have backup plan (LinkedIn recommendations, anonymous testimonials)

### **2. Case Studies** (Days 2-4)
- Need minimum **3 case studies** with metrics
- Get client approval if needed
- Gather screenshots and project details

### **3. Service Definitions** (Days 3-4)
- All 6 services must be fully documented
- Pricing validated against market
- No "TBD" or placeholder content

**If any of these slip, your launch date slips.**

---

## 🚨 **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**

1. ❌ **Waiting for perfect testimonials** → Launch with 3-5, add more later
2. ❌ **Over-engineering components** → Use MDX files, not custom CMS
3. ❌ **Vague pricing** → "Contact for quote" reduces inquiries by 40%
4. ❌ **Too technical in copy** → Clients care about outcomes, not tech stack
5. ❌ **Missing mobile testing** → 60%+ of traffic is mobile
6. ❌ **No CTAs** → Every section needs path to contact
7. ❌ **Analysis paralysis** → Launch MVP, iterate with real data

---

## 🛠️ **Tools You'll Need (All Free)**

### **Week 1 (Content):**
- ✅ Email client (for testimonial outreach)
- ✅ Google Docs/Notion (for content drafting)
- ✅ Spreadsheet (for tracking testimonials, case studies)

### **Week 2-3 (Development):**
- ✅ VS Code (or your preferred editor)
- ✅ Your existing Next.js portfolio codebase
- ✅ Browser dev tools (Chrome, Firefox)

### **Week 4 (Launch):**
- ✅ Vercel (deployment - already set up)
- ✅ Google Analytics 4 (tracking)
- ✅ Google Search Console (SEO)
- ✅ LinkedIn (promotion)

**No paid tools required for MVP!**
